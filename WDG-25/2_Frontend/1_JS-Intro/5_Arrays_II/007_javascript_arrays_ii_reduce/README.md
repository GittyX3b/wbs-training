Reduce
======

The `.reduce()` method in JavaScript is a powerful higher-order function that processes each element in an array to produce a single cumulative value.

It is used to execute a reducer function on each element of the array, which results in a single output value.

This method is very versatile and can be used for a variety of tasks such as transforming data, accumulating values, aggregating data, and more.

### Characteristics of `.reduce()`

*   **Flexibility**: Can perform almost any type of aggregation operation.
*   **Non-mutating**: Does not alter the original array unless intentionally done so inside the callback.
*   **Execution**: The function reduces the array to a single value, processing each element sequentially and combining it with the result of the previous operations.

### Practical Use Cases

*   **Data transformation**: Transforming an array of objects into a different format.
*   **Summation**: Summing up numbers in an array.
*   **Counting occurrences**: Counting instances of values in an object.
