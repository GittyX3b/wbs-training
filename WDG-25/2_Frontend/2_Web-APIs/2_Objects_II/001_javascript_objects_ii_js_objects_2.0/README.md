JS Objects 2.0
==============

In JavaScript, creating reusable and encapsulated objects can be achieved through function constructors and classes.

Both approaches are used to create new objects, but they cater to different syntactical preferences and features. Understanding these concepts is fundamental for writing more structured and maintainable JavaScript code, especially when dealing with object-oriented programming.

### Function Constructors

A function constructor in JavaScript is essentially a function used to create objects. When called with the `new` keyword, the function constructor initializes a new object with properties and methods defined within it. This method was widely used before the introduction of ES6 classes and still provides a very dynamic way to create objects.  
  

### Classes

Introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), classes in JavaScript are a syntactic sugar over the existing JavaScript prototype-based inheritance and do not introduce a new object-oriented inheritance model. Classes provide a much clearer and concise syntax to achieve what function constructors do and are easier to use, especially for those coming from other object-oriented languages.
