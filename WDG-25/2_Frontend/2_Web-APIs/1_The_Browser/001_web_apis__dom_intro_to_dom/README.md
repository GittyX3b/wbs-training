Intro to DOM
============

The DOM, or Document Object Model, is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document (like an HTML page) as a tree of objects.

Each object corresponds to a part of the document—like an element, attribute, or text. Imagine your HTML document as a family tree, with each tag being a member connected by branches.

By understanding the DOM, we can make our JavaScript code interact with it to create rich user interfaces and experiences with dynamic elements and tons of interactivity.
