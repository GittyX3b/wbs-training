2015 | React everywhere
=======================

In January 2015 React was already so big, that Facebook held a tech conference around it. [React.js Conf 2015](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2015/02/18/react-conf-roundup-2015.html). Among the many new things presented there was [React Native](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2015/03/26/introducing-react-native.html), which first allowed building native apps for iOS with React and later for Android and more.

But not only on other devices, also in bigger companies React was getting a foothold. Among others, [Netflix](https://netflixtechblog.com/netflix-likes-react-509675426db), Airbnb and Dropbox adopted it. For instance React enabled server-side rendering, allowing pre-rendered pages to be sent from servers for faster initial load times, with complex interactivity added later on the client. Its component based modularity made it easier for huge projects to swap parts of the UI.

  

Also the syntax evolved. ES6 (ECMAScript2015) brought many changes to JavaScript, which did not leave React untouched. For many years the class based syntax you see in these examples here, have been the standard. And you still might come across Class Components, not only in legacy code, but also in certain edge cases.
