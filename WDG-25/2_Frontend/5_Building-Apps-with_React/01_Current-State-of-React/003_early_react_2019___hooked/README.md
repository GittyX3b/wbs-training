2019 | Hooked
=============

In February 2019 we had a major shift in React. With [the introduction of Hooks](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html) it became way easier to write reactive components. Previously you had to use lifecycle methods on class based components, hooks introduced these capabilities to functional components, making them way more powerful and the de facto standard. Now we can use useState to manage and update component state (triggering re-renders when data changes), and useEffect to handle side effects when components mount, update, or unmount.
