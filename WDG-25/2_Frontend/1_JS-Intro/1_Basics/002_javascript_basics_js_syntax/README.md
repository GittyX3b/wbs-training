JS Syntax
=========

First, let's talk about some ground rules, after all, any language needs ✨syntax✨  
  

### JavaScript Syntax Essentials

1.  **Values:** In JavaScript, values can be:
    1.  Fixed: called literals, they are written directly in the code and will never change
    2.  Variables: they are assigned to a variable.
2.  **Variables:** You declare variables using keywords such as `let`, `const`, or `var`. Variables are used to store data values.
3.  **Operators:** JavaScript uses arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to compute values, and an assignment operator (`=`) to assign values to variables.
4.  **Expressions:** These are combinations of values, variables, and operators that compute to a value. For example, `let result = 5 * 10;` computes the multiplication of 5 and 10 and assigns it to `result`.
5.  **Keywords:** JavaScript has reserved words like `let`, `const`, `if`, `else`, `function`, which have special meanings. Keywords cannot be used as variable names.
6.  **Comments:** To make the code more readable and to leave notes, you can add comments that the JavaScript engine will ignore. Single-line comments start with `//`, and multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`.
7.  **Identifiers:** These are names given to elements like variables and functions. They must start with a letter, underscore (`_`), or dollar sign (`$`), and subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
8.  **Case Sensitivity:** JavaScript is case-sensitive, meaning that identifiers `Variable` and `variable` would be considered different.
9.  **Camel Case:** It's a common convention in JavaScript to use camelCase for identifiers (e.g., `myVariableName`).
10.  **Unicode Support:** JavaScript supports Unicode, allowing you to include characters from virtually any written language in your identifiers.
