JavaScript Intro
================

JavaScript was originally developed in 1995 by Brendan Eich while working at Netscape, with the goal of making web pages more interactive and dynamic.

Initially called Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally JavaScript, it was designed to complement HTML and CSS, enabling programmers to add interactive elements to websites without reloading the page.

This interactivity aspect helped transform the web from static pages into engaging, dynamic web applications.

When JavaScript runs in a browser it was access the entire page context via a bunch of APIs it can iteract with.   
  
That's why, in this simple example, JavaScript can find an HTML button present in the document, attach an event so that when the user clicks on it, it changes the content of another element.

And that, in an oversimplified way, is how all websites are created. Pretty neat, right?
