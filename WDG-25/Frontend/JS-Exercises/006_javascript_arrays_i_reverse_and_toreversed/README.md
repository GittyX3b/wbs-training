Reverse and ToReversed
======================

TheÂ `.reverse()` method is used to reverse the order of the elements in an array, making the last element become the first and the first element become the last.

It modifies the original array in place and returns the reversed array.

This method provides a straightforward way to invert the order of elements, which can be useful in various algorithms and data manipulation tasks.

If you don't want to modify the original array, you can use `.toReversed()` which returns a new array keeping the original intact.

#### Practical Use:

*   **Algorithm Implementation:**
    *   Useful in algorithms that require reversing the order of elements, such as in certain sorting algorithms or when implementing data structures like stacks.
*   **Data Presentation:**
    *   Helpful in scenarios where the data needs to be displayed in the opposite order, such as reversing the chronological order of events or logs.
