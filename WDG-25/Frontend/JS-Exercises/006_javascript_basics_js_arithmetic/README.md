JS Arithmetic
=============

Arithmetic operations are fundamental in JavaScript, allowing you to perform calculations using operators you might already be familiar with from math class. Here's a breakdown of common arithmetic operators in JavaScript and how they can be used in your code:

### Basic Arithmetic Operators

1.  **Addition (`+`)**: Adds two numbers together or can concatenate strings if a string is involved.
    
    *   Example: `let sum = 5 + 3; // sum is 8`
2.  **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
    
    *   Example: `let difference = 10 - 5; // difference is 5`
3.  **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies two numbers.
    
    *   Example: `let product = 4 * 7; // product is 28`
4.  **Division (`/`)**: Divides the first number by the second.
    
    *   Example: `let quotient = 20 / 4; // quotient is 5`
5.  **Modulus (`%`)**: Returns the remainder of the division of two numbers.
    
    *   Example: `let remainder = 22 % 6; // remainder is 4`

### Additional Arithmetic Operators

6.  **Increment (`++`)**: Increases an integer value by one. Can be used as `prefix` or `postfix`.
    
    *   Example:
        *   `let a = 10; a++; // Now a is 11 (postfix)`
        *   `let b = 10; ++b; // Now b is 11 (prefix)`
7.  **Decrement (`--`)**: Decreases an integer value by one. Also works as `prefix` or `postfix`.
    
    *   Example:
        *   `let c = 10; c--; // Now c is 9 (postfix)`
        *   `let d = 10; --d; // Now d is 9 (prefix)`
