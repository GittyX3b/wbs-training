Reading data
============

To read data from `localStorage`, you use the `localStorage.getItem(key)` method.

This method retrieves the value associated with the specified key.

When dealing with serialized data (like JSON strings), you'll need to parse the string back into its original format using `JSON.parse()`.

Open the browser's developer tools and inspect the Application Storage and the Console!
