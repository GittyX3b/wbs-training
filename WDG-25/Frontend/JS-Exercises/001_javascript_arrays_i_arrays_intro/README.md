Arrays intro
============

JavaScript arrays are versatile data structures used to store a collection of elements.

These elements can be of any type, including numbers, strings, and objects, and each element in an array has a numeric index, starting from zero.

Arrays in JavaScript are dynamic, meaning they can grow and shrink in size. They come equipped with a variety of built-in methods that allow developers to manipulate these collections efficiently.
