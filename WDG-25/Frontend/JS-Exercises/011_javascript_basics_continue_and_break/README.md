Continue and Break
==================

In JavaScript, the `continue` and `break` statements are used to alter the flow of loops (`for`, `while`, `do...while`). These statements are particularly useful when you want to control the execution of loop iterations under specific conditions.

### Break Statement

The `break` statement is used to immediately terminate the loop, regardless of whether the loop has finished iterating over all elements or conditions. It is typically used when you no longer need to continue the loop because a condition has been met or when you find the item you're looking for in a loop.

**Common Uses:**

*   Exiting a loop when a condition is met.
*   Stopping the execution of a loop early for performance reasons or to prevent unnecessary processing.

### Continue Statement

The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds with the next iteration. This statement is useful when you want to skip specific items or conditions in a loop but continue running the loop for the remaining items.

**Common Uses:**

*   Skipping an iteration based on specific conditions.
*   Avoiding processing or ignoring certain elements in an array or collection without stopping the entire loop.

### When to Use Break vs Continue

*   Use `break` when you need to stop the loop execution entirely after meeting a certain condition. This is effective for exiting a loop as soon as a condition that makes further iterations unnecessary or irrelevant is met.
*   Use `continue` when you want to skip the current loop iteration but continue looping over the remaining items. It's useful for filtering out items or conditions without terminating the loop.

Both `break` and `continue` enhance the control over loop execution, allowing more complex and efficient processing by directly influencing the loop's behavior based on dynamic conditions encountered during iterations. They are powerful tools that, when used properly, can help you optimize performance and achieve more precise control flow in your programs.
