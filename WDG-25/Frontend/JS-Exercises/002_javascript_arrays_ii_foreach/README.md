# ForEach

The `.forEach()` method in JavaScript is a versatile higher-order function that belongs to the Array prototype.

It allows you to execute a provided function once for each element in an array.

Unlike many other array methods that transforms the array or generates a new one based on some criteria, `.forEach()` is typically used for performing operations on each element without creating a new array.

This can include mutating the array, logging information, or performing side effects using the elements of the array.
