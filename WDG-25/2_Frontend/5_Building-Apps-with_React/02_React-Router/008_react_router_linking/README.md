Linking
=======

In React Router, the `<Link>` component is used to navigate between pages in a **single-page application (SPA)** without triggering a full page reload. This is a core part of client-side routing: it updates the URL and renders the matching component without refreshing the browser.

Using `<Link>` instead of a traditional `<a href="...">` is what allows React Router to intercept navigation and handle it internally.
