Getting data
============

As we mentioned already, by default fetch will send a GET request.

In HTTP GET is called a **request method**. There are many of these:

*   [`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET): The `GET` method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using `GET` should only retrieve data.
*   [`HEAD`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/HEAD): The `HEAD` method asks for a response identical to a `GET` request, but without the response body.
*   [`POST`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST): The `POST` method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.
*   [`PUT`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT): The `PUT` method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
*   [`DELETE`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/DELETE): The `DELETE` method deletes the specified resource.
*   [`CONNECT`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/CONNECT): The `CONNECT` method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.
