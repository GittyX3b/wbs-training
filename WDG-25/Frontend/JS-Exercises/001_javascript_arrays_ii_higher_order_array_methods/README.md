Higher Order Array Methods
==========================

In programming, a language is said to have **First-class functions** when functions in that language are treated like any other variable.

This means a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.

 This concept is a cornerstone of functional programming and is widely utilized in many programming languages, including JavaScript.

Higher-order functions allow you to create more abstract, concise, and reusable code which can manipulate other functions or data structures efficiently.  
  

### Higher-Order Array Methods in JavaScript

Methods in arrays that are higher-order functions are known as, well, higher-order array methods!

Using these methods can help reduce the complexity of the code, avoid common mistakes with loop management, and improve readability.  
  
We cannot stress enough how important is to get familiar with them!
