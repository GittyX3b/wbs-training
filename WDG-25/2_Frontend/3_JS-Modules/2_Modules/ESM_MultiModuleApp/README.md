Welcome to this exercise! Today, you’ll build a simple e-commerce landing page. We’ll be using TailwindCSS for styling and JavaScript ES Modules (ESM) to organize our code.

# Goal:

[ ] 1.Create a Landing Page: Style it with TailwindCSS.

[ ] 2.Fetch Products: On page load, fetch products from https://fakestoreapi.com/products.

[ ] 3.Check the docs here: https://fakestoreapi.com/docs

[ ] 4.Display Products: Show the products as cards.

[ ] 5.Add to Cart: Each card should have a button to add the product to the cart. The cart is an array stored in localStorage.

# Instructions

**1.Setup HTML and TailwindCSS:**

[x] Ensure your HTML file includes TailwindCSS from the CDN.

**2.Create the Directory Structure:**

[x] Inside your project directory, create a folder named modules.

[x] Inside modules, create three files: storage.js, network.js, and ui.js.

**3.Organize Functions:**

[x] storage.js: Functions related to localStorage operations.

[x] network.js: Functions related to fetching data from the API.

[x] ui.js: Functions related to creating and manipulating DOM elements.

**4.Write Main Logic in index.js:**

[x] Import the functions from the modules

[ ] Call these functions to fetch products and handle user interactions.

This setup will help you practice using ES Modules, interacting with APIs, manipulating the DOM, and using localStorage. Good luck and happy coding!
