Push
====

The `.push()` method is a fundamental array method in JavaScript used to add one or more elements to the end of an array.

This method modifies the original array by appending the specified elements and returns the new length of the array after the elements have been added.

It is versatile and can accept multiple arguments, allowing you to add multiple elements in a single call.

### Practical Use:

*   **Adding items**: Commonly used to add items to a list that is stored in an array.
*   **Dynamic collection manipulation**: Useful in scenarios where the size of the data structure is not known in advance and can grow dynamically based on user input or incoming data.
*   **Stack operations**: Can be used to implement stack data structure operations, where it represents the `push` operation of the stack.
